[Dex-Net 1.0: A Cloud-Based Network of 3D Objects for Robust Grasp Planning Using a Multi-Armed Bandit Model with Correlated Rewards](dex_net_1.pdf)

- Given an object, find a grasp that maximizes a binary success metric subjected to uncertainty in object, environment, robot state.

- Leverage a large dataset of obj-grasp-grasp quality to reduce the number of grasp evaluations required to find the optimal grasp.

- Learning hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images from scratch, with minimal prior knowledge and manual engineering.

- End-to-end training directly from pixel input to output task-space gripper motion with minimal human supervision.

- Precise camera calibration is not used.

- The method learns servo the robotic gripper to position where grasps are likely to be successful.
