[Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q Learning](Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Double_Q_Learning.pdf)

- In DQN, to construct target for the Q-function, the same Q-function is used for action selection and evaluation.

- This leads to action value over-estimation.

- They show that decoupling action selection and evaluation reduces the degree of over-estimation and increases performance.
