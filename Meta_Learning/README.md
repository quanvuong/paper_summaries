- Proposes an objective that can be differentiated n times to obtain an estimate of the n-th order gradient of the original objective.

- The original objective takes the form of sum of cost nodes in a stochastic computational graph.

- Proposes to learn an architecture with a controller and an external memory.

- The controller learns a representation of an input, binds the representation of this input to a its class label, and put the binding in the external memory.

- During test time, given an input, the controller should retrieve a label from the external memory.
