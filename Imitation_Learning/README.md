- They show that a critical challenge in applying adversarial imitation from high-dimensional sensory data is the tendency of the discriminator network to use task-irrelevant features in the state to discriminate between the expert and imitator trajectories.

- They propose to train the discriminator with a modified obj, such that the discriminator is penalized if it uses task-irrelevant feature to discriminate between states generated by the expert and states generated by the imitator.

- Use a GAN-like approach to derive a reward function from the discriminator.

- Use the proprioceptive state instead of visual observation as input into the imitator.
